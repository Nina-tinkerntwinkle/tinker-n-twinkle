# Simple Circuit
## Create your first circuit! 

### Materials needed: 
- 1 LED light
- 1 CR2032 Button Battery
- Copper Tape
- 1 copy of [template]([assets/files/simple_circuit_template.pdf](https://github.com/Nina-tinkerntwinkle/tinker-n-twinkle/blob/3633a48ef2011f48cb33e7385d5c935e5c4b251c/assets/files/simple_circuit_template.pdf))

### Instructions: 
**<ins>Step 1:</ins>** Lay the copper tape down, following the drawn out path on the template. 

**<ins>Step 2:</ins>** Fold the legs of the LED, place it on the indicated spot in the template, and use small pieces of copper tape to connect the legs to the path from Step 1. An LED has an **anode** and **cathode**. The anode is the positive side and indicates the longer leg, while the cathod is negative side and indicates the shorter leg. Make sure that your LED is lined up so that the anode points towards the + and the cathode points towards the -. 

**<ins>Step 3:</ins>** Place the button battery at the indicated spot with the negative side facing down and fold the flap switch corner. The LED should light up when the flap comes into contact with the battery. If you want the light to stay on, use a binder clip to hold the flap in place.
